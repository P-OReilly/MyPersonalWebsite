                    <h3>Fully Responsive Personal Website</h3>
                    <p>I have undertaken development of <em>this</em> website. I had previously learnt some XHTML and CSS 2.1 through my university course. I subsequently used <a title="www.pluralsight.com" href="www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> to further study the basics of HMTL and CSS. I learned about HTML5 and CSS3 using Pluralsight, and furthermore through study of their respective documentation.<br><br>
                    I completed various follow-along projects on Pluralsight, consolidating my learning, and exposing me to the development process. In order to reinforce my learning and to challenge myself, I decided I wanted to create a website from scratch, utilizing google and official documentation only, rather than taking one of the websites I created through a tutorial and simply adding my own information, images, and styles.<br><br>
                    To host the website I first considered setting up a personal server out of an old PC so that I could also set-up a media server in my home, however, I was advised of the benefit of learning to use AWS, as it is a popular technology used in industry, and after some research I chose to host my website with AWS. I purchased this domain 'poreilly.me' as I felt it suitable for a personal website. It turned out that Hosting the website was quite a simple process, a 'bucket' is created on an Amazon Simple Storage Sevice (S3), and traffic is routed to it through Amazon Route 53. Amazon provide tutorials to make the process easier and to teach about the technologies used. I'm still interested in setting up a personal server, as I'm sure it would be an invaluable learning experience. </p>

                    <h3>Shopping List App</h3>
                    <p>I am currently in the process of researching and developing a significantly more complex project; a dynamic shopping list application. The idea is to have a cross-platform mobile application connected to a simple database.</p><p>The application will open a simple landing page where a text-input box for shopping items is immediately available. Most of the functionality will be intenionally obscured from the client as simplicity and usability will be key in the app becoming an integral part of a persons daily workflow.</p>
                    <p>The intention is to store entered products as a key in a database with the respective columns being: numberOfPurchases, location, productLasts and dateOfLastPurchase</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The stored keys will be used to enable an auto-complete algorithm whilst entering products on the applications landing page text-box.</li><br>
                        <li>The location will be dynamically updated whilst performing a shop, the intention is that the user follows a linear path around a shop, picking up products in the order that they are encountered, therefore dynamically setting it's 'location' attribute; <em>informing the database of the relative location of products.</em> A feature will be required to manually set a new product's relative position in case the user missed it during their linear walk-through.</li><br>
                        <li>The 'productLasts' attribute details the time between each subsequent purchase and the 'dateOfLastPurchase' attribute details the most recent purchase of a product. Both will be dynamically updated by logic performed on each subsequent purchase of the product. 'productLasts' will be a collection of which the <em>median value</em> will be used to perform useful functions, such as, to enable a <em>smart</em> auto-complete algorithm (Upon clicking the landing-page textbox, before entering any data, to suggest likely required purchases). Also, if 'productLasts' regularly correlates with the next actual purchase of certain products, it can be considered <em>reliable</em>, it can thus be assumed that notifications for that product's purchase would be more helpful than intrusive, so the database schema must be updated to include other columns, such as 'reliability', and 'notify'.</li><br>
                        <li>The 'numberOfPurchases' attribute will be used to ensure 'smart' actions are only taken after an appropriate amount of data has been collected</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The application is intended to be used by groups, therefore certain communication features will be necessary, such as, an option 'weNeedAShop'; alerting other users that it is now necessary to perform a shop, or 'notes'; detailing specific requirements for certain products. Also required, would be features such as user accounts, user groups, notificaton badges for added products, push-notifications, and acceptable times for push notifications.</p>
                    <p>This is very much in the early stages; I have chosen certain technologies and begun to play with some of the basic features, but I plan on making steady progress and be well under way before September 2017.</p>
                    <p>Keep an eye on <a href="http://poreilly.me/pages/projects.html">POReilly.me/pages/projects</a> for further details.</p>
                    <p style="display: none;">Personal note: Whilst creating this requirements document I learned what developers mean when they say they will sit and ponder over a problem for 80% of their time, then mash it out in the last 20%. It made me consider the possibility of creating a tool to streamline the process of creating these kind of visualisations without the barrier of the English language impeeding our visualisations and/or the possibility of a tool which allows a high-level visual design, such as this, to have it's functionality tested somewhat before it is commited to code.<br>
                    I also learned why proper variable names are so fundamental to good software design; the again aid the effective visualisation of the software system without unnecessary noise distorting the image.</p>
