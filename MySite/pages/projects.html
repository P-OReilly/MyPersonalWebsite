                    <h3>Fully Responsive Personal Website</h3>
			<p>I have undertaken development of <em>this</em> website. I had previously learnt some XHTML and CSS 2.1 through my university course. I subsequently used <a title="www.pluralsight.com" href="www.pluralsight.com">Pluralsight</a> to further study the basics of HMTL and CSS, I learned about HTML5 and CSS3 using Pluralsight, and more again through study of their documentation.<br><br>
                    I completed various follow-along projects on Pluralsight, consolidating my learning, and exposing me to the development process. In order to reinforce my learning and to challenge myself. I decided I wanted to create a website from scratch rather than taking one of the websites I created through a tutorial and adding my own information, images, and styles.<br><br>
                    To host the website I first considered setting up a personal server out of an old PC so that I could also set-up a media server in my home, however, I was advised of the benefit of learning to use AWS as it is a popular technology used in industry so I chose to host my website through AWS. I purchaced this domain 'poreilly.me' as I felt it suitable for a personal website. It turned out that Hosting the website was quite a simple process, a 'bucket' is created on an Amazon Simple Storage Sevice (S3), and traffic is routed to it through Amazon Route 53. Amazon provide tutorials to make the process easier and to teach about the technologies used. I'm still interested setting up personal server, as I'm sure it would be an invaluable learning experience. </p>

                    <h3>Shopping List App</h3>
                    <p>I am currently in the process of researching and developing a significantly more complex project, a dynamic shopping list application. The idea is to have a cross-platform mobile application connected to a simple database. The application will have a simple landing page where input for shopping items is immediately accepted upon opening the app. Most of the functionality will be intenionally obscured from the client as simplicity and usability will be key in the app becoming an integral part of a persons daily workflow.</p>
                    <p>The intention is to store entered products as a key in a database with the respective columns being numberOfPurchaces, location, nextPurchace and dateOfPurchace</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The stored keys will be used to enable an auto-complete algorithm whilst entering products on the applications landing page text-box.</li><br>
                        <li>The location will be dynamically updated whilst performing a shop, the intention is that the user follows a linear path around a shop, picking up items in the order that they are encountered, therefore dynamically setting it's 'location' attribute; informing the database of the relative location of products. A feature will be required to manually set a new product's relative position in case they are missed during the linear walk-through.</li><br>
                        <li>The 'nextPurchace' details when the database expects this product will next need to be purchaces and will be set dynamically by logic performed on the 'dateOfPurchace' attribute which will be updated on each subsequent purchace of the item, 'nextPurchace' will be a collection of which the median is taken. 'timeToPurchace' will be used to inform the auto-complete algorithm (Used upon clicking the textbox, before entering any data, to suggest likely purchaces). Also, if 'nextPurchace' regularly correlates with the next actual purchace of certain products, it can be assumed that notifications for that product's purchace would more helpful than intrusive, so the database schema must be updated to include other columns, such as 'reliability', and 'notify'.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>The application is intended to be used by groups, therefore certain communication features will be necesscary such as an option 'weNeedAShop' to send an alert to other users to communicate that it is now necesscary to perform a shop, or 'notes' to detail specific requirements for certain items, also features for user accounts, linking of user accounts, notificaton badges for added items, also push-notifications.</p>
                    <p>This is very much in the early stages, I have chosen certain technologies and begun to play with some of the basic features, but I hope to make steady progress and be well under way before September 2017</p>
